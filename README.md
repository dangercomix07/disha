A Navigation platform for IITB Students
A learning project to explore a new field


Some ideas that I can think of are:


* Integrated food delivery platform for all canteens
* Mess menu integration 
* Facilitate offline meetings and hangouts among campus residents
* Invitations for Birthday parties at a common location (read as GPLS) :)
* Exploring new areas on campus for freshers
* Can be used by clubs on IITB for treasure hunt type events
* Tracking parked cycles


And many more such weird ideas which may be super difficult to actually implement
